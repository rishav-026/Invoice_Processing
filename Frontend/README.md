# Invoice_Processing-Tool
AI Invoice Processor is a web-based tool that extracts text from invoices using OCR (Tesseract &amp; Google Vision API). Users can upload images or PDFs, and the system returns raw extracted text. The frontend is built with React.js, while the backend uses Flask to process invoices.
